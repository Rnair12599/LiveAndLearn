Live-stream. Listen. Interact. Learn. We are an online live stream where students and teachers create educational content on a variety of topics to connect with their audience in a safe space.

## Inspiration
Live&Learn is inspired by students who seek to pursue education to its fullest but may not have the resources to do so. Live&Learn is meant to help equalize the playing field education by offering a live class experience for little to no cost. Live&Learn is also provides a great alternative to those who may not feel comfortable or accepted in the traditional classroom environment, and allows for them to study with peers burden free.

## What it does
Live and Learn is a platform that provides live, educational streaming services for students of all backgrounds. Live and learn is unique in that it offers a live learning experience for little to no cost, allows for skilled teachers and motivated students from around the world to meet and interact with one another, and provides tools specifically for education that make it easier to learn.

## How we built it
We built our web app with React.js for the client side, Node.js and Express to make API requests, and Google Firebase to store user data. Our streaming service was built off of the MUX video API, which makes it easy to set up and embed live streams on many platforms. We used various react libraries to incorporate additional features and provide aesthetic UI's

## Challenges we ran into
One challenge we ran into was trying to figure out how interact with a particular API's such as a third party livestream chat API. We ended up having quite a bit of difficulty trying to figure out how get authentication for the API, and after a few grueling long hours, ended up scrapping the approach for another library. Other challenges we had was getting React to maintain states correctly and show proper displays.

## Accomplishments that we are proud of
We are proud of working with technologies like various API's that we were unfamiliar with, but not being afraid. Most of all we are proud of sticking and working nearly all of the 36 hours to create the best project we could with a working demo.

## What we learned
How to work with different API's and working on all aspects of building a web applications.

## What's next for Live&Learn
A lot of improvements in the UI/UX and potentially turning it into more than just a weekend project :)
